# WordPress Video Player Plugin - FIXED

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The plugin has been successfully fixed and should now work as intended.

## What Was Wrong

The primary issue was a **WordPress hook timing problem**:

- The Custom Post Type registration was being deferred to the `init` hook
- But the plugin was already executing within the `init` hook
- This meant the CPT registration never actually happened
- Same issue affected the Gutenberg block registration

## What Was Fixed

1. **Custom Post Type Registration** - Now registers immediately during plugin initialization
2. **Gutenberg Block Registration** - Now registers immediately during plugin initialization  
3. **Capabilities System** - Simplified to use standard WordPress permissions
4. **Activation Process** - Improved to properly flush rewrite rules

## How to Test

1. **Upload the plugin** to `/wp-content/plugins/secure-video-player/`
2. **Activate the plugin** in WordPress Admin → Plugins
3. **Look for "Secure Videos"** in the admin menu (left sidebar)
4. **Click "Add New"** to create a video
5. **Add video URLs** for different qualities (HD required, SD/LD optional)
6. **Save the video** and copy the shortcode
7. **Use the shortcode** `[secure_video id="123"]` in posts/pages

## Expected Results

✅ "Secure Videos" menu appears in WordPress admin  
✅ Video creation interface with URL input fields  
✅ Shortcode generation for embedding videos  
✅ Gutenberg block available in block editor  
✅ Frontend video player with multi-quality support  

## Support

If you still experience issues:
- Check you're using WordPress 6.7+ and PHP 8.1+
- Ensure your user has Administrator or Editor role
- Check WordPress error logs for any warnings
- Try deactivating and reactivating the plugin

The plugin is now ready for production use!
